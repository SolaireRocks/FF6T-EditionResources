                    <li>Currently there are 23 achievements to obtain.</li>
                    <li>If you wish to check your current progress for each character's personal achievement, at least the ones requiring 500 uses or so, a new house north of Narshe in the WoR has an old man who will tell you.</li>
                    <li>This new event uses a lot of unknown memory and due to this it may cause issues. If there's any serious problems I'll end up getting rid of it, but so far it's fine.</li>
                    <li>To unlock something after completing the achievement, you must enter the room (so the game flags you having it.  If you don't have a costume, but have completed the requirements, head here, then leave and it should work).  Once unlocked it will remain even if the objectives are reset.  <span class="bold-text">These achievements are carried over in a New Game+.</span></li>
