        <div class="section-content">
            <p>"FF6 T-Edition EX X.X.X.ips" is essentially bonus content and other things that were not able to be put into the main mod of the game, mainly due to the upper limit of boss monster battles able to be added, even with ROM expansion.  Basically these are extra battles with various bosses from other Final Fantasy games. I put in the BGM for the "Soul Shrine" bosses, however, for personal reasons, I wanted to battle them with other BGM. I'm sorry.</p>
            <p>FF6 T-Edition EX is only for fighting specific enemies and <b>you can not play FF6 on here normally.</b> This is because various game data (enemies, magic, battle content, battle backgrounds, maps, various flags, etc) have been changed and moved around to allow for this mod.  Due to this you can only play with a saved game specially made in the main game in a certain Save Point location and then loaded here. If you attempt this please take caution as enemies are very challenging and your progress may be impossible based on your current strength/skill.</p>

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>In order to play you must have cleared the side quest "Holy Angel Ultima". Once completed you'll be able to enter the middle door in the new room of the Narshe's Beginner's Hall, the Developer's Room, which will have a special Save Point. Use this to save, then load your data into the EX Rom.</p>
            <p>To set up EX, patch the EX ips file onto a clean unmodded Japanese 1.0 FFVI ROM separate from your T-Edition ROM/file.</p>
            <p>Change your FF6 T-Edition's .srm save data file's name to the file name of the EX rom here, for example, if the game file is called "FF6TEdition.sfc", find the save file with .srm, called "FF6TEdition.srm", and rename it to, say, "FF6EX.srm" or whatever the ROM is called after patching. Just make sure they're the same name and MAKE A BACK UP SAVE OF THE .SRM PRIOR JUST IN THE EVENT YOU MESS SOMETHING UP. Save States will NOT work, so it must be the actual hard save files, the .srm one. Once you're in the game and load the save file, you'll notice the entrance of the room has been removed, but a new door is open in the back that allows you to begin battling.</p>
            <p>In the room with the Save Point, you can change party members, costumes, unlock things, shop, etc by speaking to the Moogle.</p>
            <p>Note: If you are using the English LUA scripting, EX will be in mostly full English but with some rushed menu work (for now) -Kain.</p>

        <h2 id="section3">3. Important Note <a href="#top">▲</a></h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Since it's necessary to change the .srm save data file name you may accidentally overwrite or delete it. Please make sure you make a back up of your game.</p>
           <p>"FF6 T-Edition EX X.X.X.ips" is just bonus content. All this will do is unlock portraits in the Collection Room of your main game as you progress, saving your game then reloading the .srm file back into the main FF6 T-Edition rom. It's also one requirement for the Achievement "EX Complete". For more details, please check the "newevent.html".</p>
            <p>As the game concludes with the original story, I felt there was no need to enforce this and it's solely just bonus content for you to attempt if you'd like.</p>
            <p>Note: A currently known issue is Locke's Sky Pirate costume does not show up as a selectable choice. This isn't something we can easily fix at the moment, so if you want Locke in this costume, do it back on "disc 1" before heading over to EX aka "disc 2".</p>
